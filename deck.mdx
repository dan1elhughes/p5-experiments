## Experiment 1

<XNotes>
Hover over to create random bubbles which fade over time. I would like
to spawn the circles in a pattern around the mouse, but I haven't figured
out polar coordinates yet. I also haven't figured out fading over time
so I'm drawing a 0.99 opacity square over the entire window every frame.
