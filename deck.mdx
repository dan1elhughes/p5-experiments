## Experiment 1

<XNotes>
Hover over to create random bubbles which fade over time. I would like
to spawn the circles in a pattern around the mouse, but I haven't figured
out polar coordinates yet. I also haven't figured out fading over time
so I'm drawing a 0.99 opacity square over the entire window every frame.

## Experiment 2

<XNotes>
After getting confused with polar/cartesian coordinates, I managed to
draw circles at a fixed distance but changing angle from the mouse. I
found that doing this with multiple circles gives a pretty neat phasing
effect, where circles phase in and out of sync before eventually all
overlapping again.
